    <p>and let it cool in another vessel till it be as cold</p>
    <p>as milk when it cometh from the cow</p>
    <p>then take dregs of the finest ale or else barme</p>
    <p>and cast it into the water &amp; the honey</p>
    <p>and stir all well together...</p>
    <p>and so let it stand 3 days &amp; nights...</p>

    <p>may in to another vessel clean</p>

    <br>
    <p>Steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>On a large pot hear the water until boiling</li>
        <li>Add the honey and mix until it's dissolved</li>
        <li>While it's heating skim off any scum</li>
        <li>Once boiled take it off the fire and pour it into a big vessel (you may need a funnel)</li>
        <li>Let the mixture cool until it's around your body temperature</li>
        <li>Then pour the dregs, barm of dried yeast</li>
        <li>After that cover the top not air tight</li>
        <li>And leave it be away from the sunlight, like in a closet
        </li>
        <li>By next day you should see tiny bubbles rising from the top</li>
        <li>Leaving it for more days will get a better color</li>
        <li>But after three days it's better to transfer it to another container</li>
        <li>Be careful of not transferring the dregs of yeast too</li>
        <li>And put the Bubbler Airlock on the cointainer (use a container will a small hole)</li>
        <li>Let it sit for some time from a couple of nights to six months</li>
        <li>Check it from time to time</li>
        <li>Once you think it's a good time pour it in a fitting glass and cheers!</li>
    </ol>
