    <p class="steps">Steps:</p>
    <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>On a large pot hear the water until boiling</li>
        <li>Add the honey and mix until it's dissolved</li>
        <li>While it's heating skim off any scum</li>
        <li>Once boiled take it off the fire and pour it into a big vessel (you may need a funnel)</li>
        <li>Let the mixture cool until it's around your body temperature</li>
        <li>Then pour the dregs, barm of dried yeast</li>
        <li>After that cover the top not air tight</li>
        <li>And leave it be away from the sunlight, like in a closet
        </li>
        <li>By next day you should see tiny bubbles rising from the top</li>
        <li>Leaving it for more days will get a better color</li>
        <li>But after three days it's better to transfer it to another container</li>
        <li>Be careful of not transferring the dregs of yeast too</li>
        <li>And put the Bubbler Airlock on the cointainer (use a container will a small hole)</li>
        <li>Let it sit for some time from a couple of nights to six months</li>
        <li>Check it from time to time</li>
        <li>Once you think it's a good time pour it in a fitting glass and cheers!</li>
    </ol>
